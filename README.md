# NLP-NanoDegree-Udacity @2018
Natural Language Processing Nano Degree From Udacity @2018


I used a ''Ubuntu 16.04'' to run this code with a Nvidia GPU installed on the Ubuntu host.

You can create a ''Conda Virtual'' env using the .yml file 
''' conda env create -f conda-env.yml '''

or maybe a new one try to install every dependcies by your own
'''conda create --name mynlpenv'''

and you have to ''activate'' your ''conda enviornment''
'''conda activate ./envs'''

The created virtual environment contains all the required Python libraries to execute this projects.
