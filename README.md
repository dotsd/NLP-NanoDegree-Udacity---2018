# Projects of Natural Language Processing

1. [Part-Of-Speech Tagger with Hidden Markove Model](https://github.com/udacity/hmm-tagger)

2. [Neural Machine Translation with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/aind2-nlp-capstone)

3. [End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-VUI-Capstone)



I used ``Ubuntu 16.04`` to run this code with a Nvidia GPU installed .

You can create a [Conda virtual Env](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) using yml file .
```python
conda env create -f conda-env.yml 
```

or maybe a new one try to install every dependcies .

```bash
conda create --name mynlpenv
```
and you have to `activate` the enviormnet.

```bash
conda activate ./envs
```
The created virtual environment contains all the required Python libraries to execute this projects .
