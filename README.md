# NLP-NanoDegree-Udacity @2018
Natural Language Processing Nano Degree From Udacity @2018


I used ``Ubuntu 16.04`` to run this code with a Nvidia GPU installed .

You can create a [Conda virtual Env](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) using yml file .
```python
conda env create -f conda-env.yml 
```

or maybe a new one try to install every dependcies .

```bash
conda create --name mynlpenv
```
and you have to `activate` the enviormnet.

```bash
conda activate ./envs
```
The created virtual environment contains all the required Python libraries to execute this projects .
